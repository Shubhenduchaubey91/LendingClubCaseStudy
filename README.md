## General Information
Through Exploratory Data Analysis we need to identify how various factors impact the loan repayment of a customer, also how various customer and loan attributes influence tendency of load default. In this case study we will apply our knowledge of Univariate analysis, bivariate analysis, derived fields/ deriving factors to find insights in data set.
To start with different data analysis we would need to pre-process, clean and make data ready for analysis.

## Conclusions
As part of case study we first processed the data which takes most of the time in analysis, included fixing rows , columns , deriving new columns , managing missing values etc.
Then we identified which are numerical variables and which are categorical, further identifying Integer, float and strings.
Then we performed Univariate analysis numeric variables to see how various variable are distributed to find out ranges and quartiles by graph.
